# Azure Computing and Networking Lab - Part 3

## Overview
In Part 3 of this lab, I configured a Network Security Group (NSG) to control ICMP traffic, observed various types of network traffic (SSH, DHCP, DNS, and RDP) using Wireshark, and cleaned up the Azure resources created during this lab.

## Objectives
- Configure NSG rules to manage ICMP traffic.
- Analyze SSH, DHCP, DNS, and RDP traffic using Wireshark.
- Clean up Azure resources.

## Steps

### 1. Configuring a Firewall (Network Security Group)
1. I initiated a perpetual ping from my Windows 10 VM to my Ubuntu VM by running:
   ```bash
   ping 10.0.0.5 -t
   ```
2. I opened the Network Security Group (NSG) associated with my Ubuntu VM and disabled inbound ICMP traffic.

3. Back in my Windows 10 VM, I observed the ICMP traffic in Wireshark and the Ping activity in Command Prompt, noting that the ping requests started timing out.

4. I re-enabled ICMP traffic in the NSG for the Ubuntu VM.
5. Back in my Windows 10 VM, I confirmed that ICMP traffic resumed in Wireshark and that ping replies were now working.

6. Finally, I stopped the ping activity by pressing `Ctrl+C` in Command Prompt.

### 2. Observing SSH Traffic
1. I logged back into my Windows 10 VM and started a new packet capture in Wireshark.
2. I filtered for SSH traffic in Wireshark by entering:
   ```bash
   ssh
   ```
3. From my Windows 10 VM, I used PowerShell to establish an SSH connection to my Ubuntu VM by running:
   ```bash
   ssh labuser@10.0.0.5
   ```
4. I entered the username and password when prompted and executed a few commands in the SSH session.

5. I observed the SSH traffic in Wireshark.
![12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1edca02-3a3f-4f73-9ca0-702d26e02315)
6. I exited the SSH session by typing:
   ```bash
   exit
   ```

### 3. Observing DHCP Traffic
1. I filtered for DHCP traffic in Wireshark by entering:
   ```bash
   dhcp
   ```
2. From my Windows 10 VM, I opened PowerShell as an administrator and attempted to issue a new IP address by running:
   ```bash
   ipconfig /renew
   ```
3. I observed the DHCP traffic in Wireshark as the VM negotiated for a new IP address.

### 4. Observing DNS Traffic
1. I filtered for DNS traffic in Wireshark by entering:
   ```bash
   dns
   ```
2. From my Windows 10 VM, I used `nslookup` in Command Prompt to query the IP addresses for `pixar.com` and `disney.com`:
   ```bash
   nslookup pixar.com
   nslookup disney.com
   ```
3. I observed the DNS queries and responses in Wireshark.

### 5. Observing RDP Traffic
1. I filtered for RDP traffic in Wireshark by entering:
   ```bash
   tcp.port == 3389
   ```
![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebf1a0e0-8fa3-469a-ab25-52fd61265e87)
2. I observed the non-stop traffic generated by the RDP protocol and noted that this occurs because RDP is constantly transmitting a live stream between the client and server.

### 6. Lab Cleanup
1. I closed the Remote Desktop connection to my Windows 10 VM.
2. I navigated to the Azure Portal and deleted the Resource Group(s) created at the beginning of this lab.
3. I verified that the Resource Group(s) were successfully deleted.
